For the early detection of lung tumor detection, the CT image data from cloud server is considered. The data consist of healthy and affected lung images. The threshold based segmentation has the problem of segmenting the background information as region of interest hence a clustering based segmentation approach is suggested in this objective. The experimentation part takes place on four dimensions: 1) IoT devices enabled data acquisition for lung cancer diagnosis and the data are transmitted to the cloud server for diagnostic process. 2) The data is augmented and filtered, and then the image is used for the segmentation process. The
